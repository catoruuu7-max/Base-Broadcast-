# BASE HANDBOOK 📡📔 



**1. Humans and Xenogeneics shall co-exist.**
The world’s already broken once. Don’t make it bleed again.


**2. No spreading toxins.**
Hatred, mockery, or conflict — all are lethal to the colony. Breathe peace or be purged.


**3. Keep your spores clean.**
NSFW, gore, or corrupt data are forbidden within Base walls. Purity keeps us alive.


**4. Tampering with research files is treason.**
Spam, flood, or distortion of records will lead to containment. Order above chaos.


**5. Obey the Trail Court.**
The Trail Court (admins) hold the final word of judgment. Their verdict is law.


**6. Heed the Defense Agency.**
The Defense Agency (mods) maintain balance and safety within the colony. Defy them, and you risk eradication.


**7. Mutations are to be celebrated.**
Difference is survival. Be strange, be you, but don’t poison the air others breathe.


**8. Report infection.**
Any disturbance, threat, or corrupted behavior must be reported to the Defense Agency immediately. Transparency saves lives.
